# elder-scrolls-legends-tracker
Application for logging games and rewards in Elder Scrolls Legends.

Unfortunately ESL do not produce text log, hence this application relays on adding data manually. You can log your games and rewards from small window that appears over ESL window, and can be collapsed while you are playing. 

This is early beta version, any feedback is very welcome!

## Features
 - Create decks and log games against them. See how good deck is!
 - View winrate against different opponent classes
 - Log your rewards. View basic breakdown what you have gained, or export to spreadsheet for more advanced analysis
 - Create screenshots with one click (no more prinscreen, paste and save)

## Future developments
 - add card management for decks
 - deck history
 - advanced statistics
 - log opening new packs
